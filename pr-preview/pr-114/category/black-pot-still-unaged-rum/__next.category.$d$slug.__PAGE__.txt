It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la fée verte 'the green fairy'. While sometimes casually referred to as a liqueur, absinthe unlike pastis is not usually bottled with sugar or sweeteners. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.","refs":[],"parents":[],"slug":"absinthe","type":"category"}],"slug":"herbsaint","refs":[],"ingredients":[],"quantity":{"amount":0.25,"unit":"oz"}},{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Black pot still unaged rum","categoryType":"spirit","parents":[{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Black pot still rum","categoryType":"spirit","parents":[{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Rum","categoryType":"spirit","refs":[],"parents":[],"slug":"rum","type":"category"}],"refs":[],"slug":"black-pot-still-rum","type":"category"}],"refs":[],"slug":"black-pot-still-unaged-rum","type":"category","quantity":{"amount":2.25,"unit":"oz"}},{"$schema":"../../../schemas/ingredient.schema.json","name":"Seltzer","type":"soda","slug":"seltzer","categories":[],"refs":[],"ingredients":[],"quantity":{"amount":1,"unit":"oz"}}],"attributions":[{"relation":"bar","source":"Smuggler's Cove","location":"San Francisco, CA"}],"refs":[{"type":"book","title":"smugglers-cove","page":266}],"slug":"doctor-funk","chapter":"09_Eight Essential Exotic Elixirs","source":{"$schema":"../../../../schemas/book.schema.json","name":"Smuggler's Cove","link":"https://www.smugglerscovesf.com/book","description":"Cast aside your cares and worries.
