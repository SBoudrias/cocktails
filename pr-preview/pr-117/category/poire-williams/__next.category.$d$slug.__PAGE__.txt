It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la fée verte 'the green fairy'. While sometimes casually referred to as a liqueur, absinthe unlike pastis is not usually bottled with sugar or sweeteners. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed.","refs":[],"parents":[],"slug":"absinthe","type":"category","quantity":{"amount":1,"unit":"dash"}},{"$schema":"../../../schemas/ingredient.schema.json","name":"Cane syrup","type":"syrup","slug":"cane-syrup","categories":[],"refs":[],"ingredients":[],"quantity":{"amount":1,"unit":"tsp"}},{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Poire Williams","categoryType":"liqueur","parents":[{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Brandy (Pear)","categoryType":"spirit","refs":[],"parents":[],"slug":"brandy-pear","type":"category"}],"refs":[],"slug":"poire-williams","type":"category","quantity":{"amount":0.75,"unit":"oz"}},{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Whiskey (Rye)","categoryType":"spirit","parents":[{"$schema":"../../schemas/category.schema.json","name":"Whiskey","categoryType":"spirit","refs":[],"parents":[],"slug":"whiskey","type":"category"}],"refs":[],"slug":"whiskey-rye","type":"category","quantity":{"amount":1.25,"unit":"oz"}}],"instructions":["Rinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe and discard excess","Stir all ingredients with ice for 20-30 seconds","Strain into the prepared glass","Express lemon zest oils over the drink and discard"],"refs":[{"type":"youtube","videoId":"B0bZyraafA0","start":0}],"slug":"pear-sazerac","attributions":[],"source":{"$schema":"../../../../schemas/youtube-channel.schema.json","name":"Truffles On The Rocks","link":"https://www.youtube.com/@TrufflesOnTheRocks","description":"Hi!
