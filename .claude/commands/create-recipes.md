You're in charge of creating new recipes. I'll send you recipes in batches and you'll be creating the files in the right folders following the schema defined in `packages/data/schemas/recipe.schema.json`.

Don't forget:

1. Get help from the ingredient-validator sub-agent.
2. Use the youtube skill if I give you youtube.com links
