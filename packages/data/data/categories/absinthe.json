  "description": "Absinthe is an anise-flavored spirit derived from several plants, including the flowers and leaves of grand wormwood, together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Historically described as a highly alcoholic spirit, it is 45–74% ABV (alcohol by volume). Absinthe traditionally has a natural green color but may also be colorless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as la fée verte 'the green fairy'. While sometimes casually referred to as a liqueur, absinthe unlike pastis is not usually bottled with sugar or sweeteners. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water before being consumed."
